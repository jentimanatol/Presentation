## Project Overview

### Group Members

•	The group members are not yet finalized.

### App Overview

The proposed app is a dating and social networking platform that connects users based on their physical attractiveness (measured by the golden ratio), intellectual interests, and material status.

###  Purpose

"Find Your Perfect Match with the Beauty Ratio Dating App."

###  Category

•	Social Networks & Dating: Connecting people for dating and building social and professional networks.

###  Usage Expectations

•	Frequency: We anticipate users will engage with the app daily.

•	Time of Day: Users are likely to use the app during the evenings and weekends when they are most socially active.

###  Benefits

•	Uniqueness: The app uses innovative metrics to match users based on beauty, intellect, and lifestyle, providing a comprehensive approach to matchmaking.

•	User Experience: Offers a personalized and engaging user experience with advanced matchmaking algorithms.

###  Market Comparison

•	Existing Apps: There are dating apps like Tinder and Bumble, but none utilize the golden ratio and comprehensive personal data analysis to this extent.

•	Differentiation: The app's unique approach to combining beauty, intellect, and material status sets it apart from existing platforms.

###  Ideal Outcome

The ideal outcome is to create meaningful connections by ensuring users are matched with partners who not only meet their aesthetic preferences but also share intellectual and lifestyle compatibility. Users will engage in deeper, more fulfilling relationships facilitated by the app's unique matchmaking algorithms.

### Development Time

•	Estimated Time: Approximately 2-3 weeks, depending on the group size. If additional time is needed, certain features may be simplified or deferred.

###  Challenges

1.	Technical Unknowns:

o	Gathering data from browsing history and social media activity.

2.	Complex Algorithms:

o	Developing an algorithm to analyze facial features in relation to the golden ratio (Phi = 1.618).

### Team Roles
